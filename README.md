# Corporación Favorita Grocery Sales Forecasting

In my assessment, the generally poor predictive performance observed when applying standard forecasting techniques to the Kaggle ‘Favorita’ dataset arises primarily from the lack of segmentation in the data. For forecasts to achieve greater accuracy and reliability, an essential preliminary step should involve clustering the data. Ecuador, as a nation, is characterised by profound socio-economic divisions; consequently, supermarkets situated even within the same city may exhibit markedly divergent consumer behaviours and sales patterns. If these heterogeneities are captured through clustering and analysed separately, the resultant predictive models are likely to be significantly more robust.

However, even under optimal segmentation, it must be acknowledged that any forecasts of Ecuadorian consumer activity remain highly constrained temporally. In particular, the predictive horizon should likely be limited to no more than several weeks. This is due to the pronounced dependency of national consumption on the global price of oil—Ecuador’s principal economic driver. Fluctuations in oil prices can exert an influence on retail activity of up to 500%, particularly on a weekly basis, whereas cultural and public holidays may contribute variances of up to 50%.

To attempt forecasting Ecuador’s retail dynamics without first clustering population regions is, in my view, methodologically unsound. It is akin to aggregating consumer behaviour data from three demographically and culturally distinct Israeli towns—such as Bnei Brak, Umm al-Fahm, and Nof HaGalil—and attempting to draw unified conclusions. Each, if modelled independently, may yield highly reliable predictions, but when lumped together, the result is statistical chaos.

Similarly, the approach often suggested in academic settings—where Ecuadorian provinces are merely treated as separate entities (e.g., Haifa versus the Negev, in the Israeli context)—provides insufficient resolution. It is a superficial division that overlooks the crucial intra-provincial disparities. As such, it contributes little to the quality of forecasting.
