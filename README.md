During the course of my main project, I accessed and filtered the required dataset directly from the SQL database within my Google Colab environment. This was achieved without the intermediate step of exporting the data to a CSV file, which would typically be re-imported into Python for analysis. This technical approach aﬀorded greater flexibility, allowing me to iteratively assess and refine the scope of data retrieved from the database in real time. I believe this method contributed meaningfully to the quality and eﬃciency of my data analysis, enabling me to achieve the insights I aimed for. Subsequently, I performed data filtering and initial manipulations using Python. This stage also included preliminary exploratory analysis, such as observing demographic patterns among TravelTide customers. I found that overall spending on bookings via the TravelTide platform was relatively consistent across customer segments. Specifically, individual travellers or couples without children tended to travel more frequently and opt for more aﬀordable options. In contrast, larger family groups were associated with higher overall booking costs—largely due to additional flight seats and larger accommodation requirements—though such customers tended to travel less frequently. A notable exception was younger customers, particularly those under the age of 25, who typically spent less per journey. As the next step, I compared my findings using supervised machine learning — specifically, a Decision Tree model, which demonstrated an internal reliability of up to 96%. I then proceeded to validate these insights through unsupervised machine learning, selecting five clusters and applying both K-Means and DBSCAN algorithms. This combined approach is more commonly seen in fields such as medicine or high-tech industries. However, by the time I began working with DBSCAN, approximately three- quarters of the project preparation had already been completed. As such, I chose to pursue both techniques primarily for educational purposes and to enhance the analytical depth of the study. Ultimately, combining both supervised and unsupervised methods allowed me to observe where customer-defined targets align with naturally emerging patterns in the data. This dual perspective not only reinforced the robustness of the supervised model but also revealed more nuanced customer behaviours through clustering, particularly in the DBSCAN analysis. While this was not initially part of the planned methodology, it became a valuable extension that deepened my understanding of customer segmentation techniques.
